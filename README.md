# HSBC Monthly Bank Analyzer — Bilingual v2.2

**What's new (v2.2):**
- Explicit support for **'Paid out'** and **'Paid in'** logic.
- Right-to-left tail parsing: captures multiple trailing numbers
  (amount columns + optional balance) and infers debit/credit robustly.
- Keeps improved OUT detection (DD/SO/DR/OBP/AMEX/NOVUNA/BP) and inbound transfer exceptions.
- Bilingual UI (English/中文) and revenue split (Chiyuan 20% / Jiahan 80%).
